/**
 * Tasks:
 * 1. Create a class for an Animal, where we give it a "species", "country of origin", and "type" (mammal, amphibian, reptile, etc.)
 * 2. Give it some active Actions, such as "move", "eat", "communicate"
 * 3. Give it some passive Actions, such as "is it a predator", "is it able to swim", "can it fly" â€” use IF statements to work this out from things like the type or species
 * 4. Create an interface for the Animal called AnimalInterface that shows what properties and actions the class should have
 * 5. Create a function to convert the class into an object with the same interface
 *
 * Bonus task (might require some Googling):
 * 1. Create another class that extends from Animal, for example, Fish might be a class that extends from Animal and sets the default for "type" to "amphibian"
 * 2. In the interface, make some of the options conditional, so that we could either include or exclude certain things when returning the object
 * 3. Interact between the classes, for example: Create an "attack" function, and then passing an instance of another animal as the parameter means that we can change values in that other instance, such as its "health"
